Actively secure two-party computation (2PC) is one of the canonical building blocks
in modern cryptography. One main goal for designing actively secure 2PC protocols is to reduce the communication overhead, compared to semi-honest 2PC protocols. In this talk, we introduce our recent progress in closing this gap by proposing two new actively secure constant-round 2PC protocols, one with one-way communication of $2\kappa+5$ bits per AND gate (for $\kappa$-bit computational security and any statistical security) and one with total communication of $2\kappa+\rho+5$ bits per AND gate (for $\rho$-bit statistical security).

In particular, our first protocol essentially matches the one-way communication of semi-honest half-gates protocol. Our optimization is achieved by three new techniques:

1. Building on the recent compression technique by Dittmer et al. (Crypto'22), we introduce a new form of authenticated bits and propose a new technique of generating authenticated AND triples to reduce the one-way communication of preprocessing from $5\ssp+1$ bits to $2$ bits per AND gate for $\rho$-bit statistical security.

2. Unfortunately, the above compressing technique is only compatible with a less compact AG (CCS'17). We designed a new checking method using dual execution which allows us to use a more compact AG (Crypto'15), and meanwhile keep compatible with the compression technique. Our new technique can achieve one-way communication of $2\kappa+5$ bits per AND gate.

3. In terms of total communication, we notice that the communication overhead of the consistency checking method by Dittmer et al. (Crypto'22) can be optimized with additional one-round of interaction. This reduces the online communication from $2\kappa+3\rho$ bits down to $2\kappa+\rho+1$ bits per AND gate. Combined with our first contribution, this yields total amortized communication of $2\kappa+\rho+5$ bits.
