I made a \\(\LaTeX\\) template for cryptologic research papers at <https://github.com/RickFreemanCui/Crypto-LaTeX-Template>. It features:

-   [Cryptobib](https://github.com/cryptobib/export) as a submodule, which means that your can access the latest cryptobib in your project by running the `git pull` commands.

-   Alex J. Malozemoff's `crypto.sty` macros, which offers common commands for typesetting functionalities, protocols, sets, finite fields, etc.

Feel free to check it out.
