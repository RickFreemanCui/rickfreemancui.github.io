This is a Crypto 2022 paper that describes how to construct
authenticated garbled circuit using correlations that allow efficient
PCGS (e.g., MT, VOLE). Using the AGC, we can run actively secure 2PC
afterwards.

This work inspired us to conduct a follow-up work [Authenticated Garbling From Correlated OT]({{< relref "cot_ag" >}}).

Here is the slides I have prepared [Slides](/ox-hugo/Auth-GC-from-VOLE.pdf).
