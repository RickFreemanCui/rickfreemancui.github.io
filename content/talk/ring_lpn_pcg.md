The \\( n^2 \\) computational overhead of PCGs for the OLE/MT correlation
has long been a trouble and only recently have we come up with some
creative solution (for authenticated triples over \\( \mathbb{F}\_2 \\)).

This is a Crypto 2020 paper that shows how to create such a
correlation over \\( \mathbb{F}\_{2^{\rho}} \\) using Ring-LPN. I recall
giving talks about this construction in various occacions but the
details have been lost now. <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2024-02-28 Wed&gt;</span></span>

Anyway, here is the slides I have prepared for a LATTICE group meeting
at Dec. 2021 [Slides](</ox-hugo/Ring-LPN PCG.pptx>).
