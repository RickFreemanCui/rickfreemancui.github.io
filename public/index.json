This has been demonstrated in the FAEST signature scheme (Crypto 2023).\nOne natural ideal is to utilize this framework to prove other OWF, e.g. LPN-based. In this work, we apply the sketching technique of [BGI16] to prove that the LPN noise consists of a series of unit vectors, and then apply QuickSilver to prove the validity of LPN witness. After transforming the proof system under the VOLE in the Head framework from designated verifier to public verifier, we get a signature scheme called ReSolveD. The scheme shows smaller signature size as compared to previous state-of-the-art SDitH (Eurocrypt 2023, Asiacrypt 2023)\nThis work is published as ReSolveD: Shorter Signatures from Regular Syndrome Decoding and VOLE-in-the-Head, Public Key Cryptogrpahy 2024 ePrint 2024/040\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/paper/resolved/","summary":"The VOLE in the Head framework demonstrates very competetive performance as compared to the traditional MPC in the Head framework.
